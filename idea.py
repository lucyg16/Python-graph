# ask user for input file of data
input = "inputFile"

# ask user for desired index d
index = d

# create dictionary to add values to
list_of_index_d = []

#iterate through list of given data
for i in input_row;
    for j in input_column:
        if j[d] not in dictionary
            # create list to append to dictionary of that value
            # add j[d] to list_of_index_d if j[d] as identifier if does not already exist
            # then add the corresponding value over in the other matrix
        else
            #add the value to the list with identifier j[d] in the dictionary



# now you should have the dictionary of identifiers with lists of values

#now make a box plot using the code provieded on matplotlib, replacing the input with the dictionary that you have created
